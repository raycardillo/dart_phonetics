/// Encodes a string to a Soundex value. Soundex is a classic encoding scheme
/// used to compare names that sound similar. It can also be used to find
/// words that sound similar.
///
/// While the algorithm is fairly simple, there are several variants, so make
/// sure you know which variant you need if working with existing data. The
/// most notable exceptions are in census data and SQL implementations.
///
/// The implementation of this class is unique because it uses a mapping
/// strategy with several configurable behaviors that can be enabled or
/// disabled to support many variants. it's also possible to use a custom
/// mapping for other languages or character sets.
///
/// For convenience, there are several static instances available for some of
/// the more common implementations:
/// - [americanEncoder] - Implements the standard American Soundex algorithm
/// as described by _The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)_
/// (https://www.archives.gov/research/census/soundex.html).
/// - [specialEncoder] - This is the same as [americanEncoder] but the `H` and
/// `W` are not ignored like they were supposed to have been. The census data
/// for 1880 through 1910 included standard codes as well as these special
/// codes randomly intermixed.
/// - [genealogyEncoder] - Implements the rules from the _genealogy.com_
/// (https://www.genealogy.com/articles/research/00000060.html) website. This
/// is the same as the [americanEncoder] but ignored characters are not
/// tracked for consonant breaks and are completely ignored instead.
///
/// If you want (or need) to understand more details, here are some good
/// references that help explain the history and variants:
/// - https://web.archive.org/web/20011107131342/http://www.bluepoof.com/Soundex/info.html
